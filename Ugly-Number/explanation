PROBLEM : 

Write a program to find the n-th ugly number.
Ugly numbers are positive numbers whose prime factors only include 2, 3, 5. 

Example:
Input: n = 10
Output: 12
Explanation: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12 is the sequence of the first 10 ugly numbers.

Note:
1 is typically treated as an ugly number.
n does not exceed 1690.

SOLUTION :

Create an array of ugly number's series to store.
Create 3 integers to store current minimum multiple of 2,3 and 5.
Create 3 iterator for 2,3 and 5.
Create 1 integer of next ugly number.

ALGO :
1) Apply for loop from i=0 to i less than n.
2) Store minimum from 3 ugly number's multiple.
3) Compare ugly number to see if it is multiple of 2,3,or 5.
4) Increase the value of that respective iterator.
5) Update the value of next multiple of that number.
