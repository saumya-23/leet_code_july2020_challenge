Problem :
You have a total of n coins that you want to form in a staircase shape, where every k-th row must have exactly k coins.
Given n, find the total number of full staircase rows that can be formed.
n is a non-negative integer and fits within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.

Example 1:
n = 5
The coins can form the following rows:
¤
¤ ¤
¤ ¤
Because the 3rd row is incomplete, we return 2.

Solution Explanation:

In this approach I applied the concept of "Sum of N natural numbers".
Firstly, I handled all the corner cases(For n = 0, 1, 2).
Then I applied a loop upto "n" numbers and perform following 2 operations :
1) add value of i to sum;
2) compare "sum" to given input "N".
    If sum == N. It means we have found exact solution that forms proper staircase.
    So, return "i".
    If sum > N. It means the proper staircase will be formed upto number "i-1" for given input "N".
    So, return "i-1".

** Take type as "long" of variable "sum". Otherwise, it will give error for large input values.
